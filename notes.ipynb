    "\n",
    "[Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is.html) is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant\n",
    "that can help you understand, build, extend, and operate AWS applications. You can ask questions\n",
    "about AWS architecture, your AWS resources, best practices, documentation, support, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Q is supported in the AWS Management Console, IDEs like VScode and JetBrains, AWS Documentation Site, Command Line, and even Microsoft Teams and Slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of Amazon Q Developer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Q Developer includes the following capabilities:\n",
    "- `Chat` – Amazon Q answers natural language questions in English about AWS, including questions about AWS service selection, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) usage, documentation, best practices, and your AWS resources. Amazon Q responds with information summaries or step-by-step instructions, and includes links to its information sources.\n",
    "- `Conversation memory` – Amazon Q uses the context of your conversation to inform future responses for the duration of your conversation.\n",
    "- `Code improvements and advice` – Within IDEs, Amazon Q can answer questions about software development, improve your code, and generate new code.\n",
    "- `Code completion` – As you write code, Amazon Q automatically generates suggestions, in real time, based on your existing code and comments.\n",
    "- `Troubleshoot and support` – Amazon Q can help you understand errors in the AWS Management Console and provides access to live AWS Support agents to address your AWS questions and issues.\n",
